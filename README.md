# DoCSocTools

This Nx-based monorepo contains a series of tools made by Kishan Sambhi (kss22) for DoCSoc at Imperial College London for the committee of academic year 2024-2025.
They are designed to help the committee manage their responsibilities and make their lives easier, by providing tools to automate and simplify common tasks.

## Strcuture of the repo

The repo is structured as an Nx monorepo (I recommend you look at the [Nx documentation](https://nx.dev) for more information on how to use it). You can also have a look at the Nx readme at the bottom of this document.

## Tools

-   `clickup/calendar-sync`: A rust tool that syncs the DoCSoc ClickUp calendar with the DoCSoc Google Calendar. It is designed to be run as a cron job on a server. (application)
-   `common/util`: A set of common utilities used by other tools written in TypeScript (library)
-   `email/mailmerge`: A TypeScript library that can be used to generate emails from templates and send them. It is designed to be used in conjunction with the `email/mailmerge-cli` tool, but can be used by itself (library)
-   `email/mailmerge-cli`: A TypeScript CLI tool that can be used to generate emails from templates, regenerate them after modifying the results, upload them to Outlook drafts and send them. (library & application)
-   `collection/`: A Next.js Application that allows us to manage merchandise collections securely. Designed to be ran as a docker container with a Postgres DB. (application)

Each tool's directory has a README with more information on how to use it.

## Building

### Build for development

> [!NOTE]
> You should use `build-local` when working on just the TypeScript code, as `build` will build all tools (TypeScript and Rust) to `/dist/`, including Next.js production builds, whereas `build-local` only compiles TypeScript libraries like those in `common` and `mailmerge`.

```
npx nx run-many -t build build-local
```

`build` builds all tools (TypeScript and Rust) to `/dist/`, `build-local` builds the typescript tools to `dist/` folders in **each tool's directory**.

You should use `build-local` when working on just the TypeScript code.

You can run tasks for a specific tool by running, for example:

```bash
npx nx build collection
npx nx test mailmerge
npx nx run eactivities:test # alternate syntax for running tasks
# etc.
```

Where `build` is the task and `collection` is the tool.

It may help to install the NX Console plugin to view all available tasks.

### Building for production

```
npx nx run-many -t build
```

## Making a release

NOTE: See Nuclino for cargo & npm registry login details.

It is assumed you have already logged into the npm and cargo registries.

```
npx nx release
```

This will build & release all libraries (so everything bar `collection`)

### Documentation

You can get API documentation for all TypeScript libraries in the repo by running:

```
npm run docs
```

This will output the documentation to `./docs/` in the repo root.

### Linting

```bash
npx nx run-many -t lint
```

### Testing

```bash
npx nx run-many -t test
```

## Nx Mono repo info

### Rust

The plugin `@monodon/rust` has been added to Nx to allow for Rust projects to be built and run in the monorepo. This is used by the `calendar-sync` tool.

The plugin has create a Cargo workspace in the root of the monorepo as such, and all builds for all packages are done in the root of the monorepo and sent to `dist` in the repo root.

### Docker

The NX plugin `@nx-tools/nx-container` has been added to allow for Docker images to be built and run in the monorepo. This is used by the `collection` tool.

E.g. to build `collection` as a Docker image `docsoc/collection`:

```bash
npx nx container collection
```

### Prisma

The NX plugin `@nx-tools/nx-prisma` has been added to allow the use of prisma.

Prisma command can be run following this pattern:

If the original command is, for example `prisma studio`, then the command to run it in the monorepo is `npx nx prisma-studio <project>`.
E.g. to run `prisma studio` for the `collection` project:

```bash
npx nx prisma-studio collection

# this also works:
cd collection
npx nx prisma-studio # autodetets the project
```

# Weird Bits

### Q: Why does `collection` and `template` not have a `package.json`

This i because they pull their deps in from the root `package.json`: this way, we only need to maintain one dependency list for common deps like React, etc.

## Integrate with editors

Enhance your Nx experience by installing [Nx Console](https://nx.dev/nx-console) for your favorite editor. Nx Console
provides an interactive UI to view your projects, run tasks, generate code, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and
comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Nx plugins and code generators

Add Nx plugins to leverage their code generators and automated, inferred tasks.

```
# Add plugin
npx nx add @nx/react

# Use code generator
npx nx generate @nx/react:app demo

# Run development server
npx nx serve demo

# View project details
npx nx show project demo --web
```

Run `npx nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [code generators](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code) and [inferred tasks](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks) in the docs.

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
npx nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

-   [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/features/share-your-cache)
-   [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)
-   [Learn more how to setup CI](https://nx.dev/recipes/ci)

## Explore the project graph

Run `npx nx graph` to show the graph of the workspace.
It will show tasks that you can run with Nx.
