# DoCSocTools

This Nx-based monorepo contains a series of tools made by Kishan Sambhi (kss22) for DoCSoc at Imperial College London for the committee of academic year 2024-2025.
They are designed to help the committee manage their responsibilities and make their lives easier, by providing tools to automate and simplify common tasks.

## Strcuture of the repo

The repo is structured as an Nx monorepo (I recommend you look at the [Nx documentation](https://nx.dev) for more information on how to use it). You can also have a look at the Nx readme at the bottom of this document.

## Tools

-   `clickup/calendar-sync`: A rust tool that syncs the DoCSoc ClickUp calendar with the DoCSoc Google Calendar. It is designed to be run as a cron job on a server.
-   `common/util`: A set of common utilities used by other tools written in TypeScript
-   `email/libmailmerge`: A TypeScript library that can be used to generate emails from templates and send them. It is designed to be used in conjunction with the `email/mailmerge-cli` tool, but can be used by itself
-   `email/mailmerge-cli`: A TypeScript CLI tool that can be used to generate emails from templates, regenerate them after modifying the results, upload them to Outlook drafts and send them.

Each tool's directory has a README with more information on how to use it.

## Building

### Build for development

```
npx nx run-many -t build build-local
```

`build` builds all tools (TypeScript and Rust) to `/dist/`, `build-local` builds the typescript tools to `dist/` folders in **each tool's directory**.

You should use `build-local` when working on just the TypeScript code

### Building for production

```
npx nx run-many -t build
```

### Linting

```bash
npx nx run-many -t lint
```

### Testing

```bash
npx nx run-many -t test
```

## Nx Mono repo info

The plugin `@monodon/rust` has been added to Nx to allow for Rust projects to be built and run in the monorepo. This is used by the `calendar-sync` tool.
The plugin has create a Cargo workspace in the root of the monorepo as such, and all builds for all packages are done in the root of the monorepo and sent to `dist` in the repo root.

## Integrate with editors

Enhance your Nx experience by installing [Nx Console](https://nx.dev/nx-console) for your favorite editor. Nx Console
provides an interactive UI to view your projects, run tasks, generate code, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and
comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Nx plugins and code generators

Add Nx plugins to leverage their code generators and automated, inferred tasks.

```
# Add plugin
npx nx add @nx/react

# Use code generator
npx nx generate @nx/react:app demo

# Run development server
npx nx serve demo

# View project details
npx nx show project demo --web
```

Run `npx nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [code generators](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code) and [inferred tasks](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks) in the docs.

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
npx nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

-   [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/features/share-your-cache)
-   [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)

## Explore the project graph

Run `npx nx graph` to show the graph of the workspace.
It will show tasks that you can run with Nx.
