		<p>Dear Kishan,</p>
<p>I hope you are well. Do you like the attachment?</p>
<p>If you are seeing this email, it means that the new mail merge tool is working as expected.</p>
<p>For it was this email you see, that was sent by complete mail merge pipeline.</p>
<p>Of course, some things are still missing, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attachments</li>
<li>Crash-proofing so you don't double send emails</li>
<li>A nice CLI</li>
<li>Docs</li>
</ul>
<p>But it does work!</p>
<p>Kind regards,<br>
Some TypeScript code on behalf of Kishan Sambhi (he/him)<br>
