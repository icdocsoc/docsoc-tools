Dear Kishan,

I hope you are well. Did this change the HTML?

If you are seeing this email, it means that the new mail merge tool is working as expected.

For it was this email you see, that was sent by complete mail merge pipeline.

Of course, some things are still missing, namely:

-   Attachments
-   Crash-proofing so you don't double send emails
-   A nice CLI
-   Docs

But it does work!

Kind regards,
