Dear {{ name }},

I hope you are well.

If you are seeing this email, it means that the new mail merge tool is working as expected.

For it was this email you see, that was sent by complete mail merge pipeline.

Of course, some things are still missing, namely:
{% for item in alist %}
- {{ item }}{% endfor %}


But it does work!

Kind regards,
